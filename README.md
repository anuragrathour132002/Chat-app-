The project aims to provide a platform where users can send and receive messages in real time. Users should be able to create chat rooms, join existing ones, and exchange messages with other users in the same room. The backend services will be hosted on Firebase, and users will authenticate with their Google accounts.



The application should have the following features:

1. Google User Authentication: Users should be able to log in and log out using their Google accounts via Firebase Authentication.

2. Chat Rooms: Users should be able to create, join, and leave chat rooms.

3. Real-Time Messaging: Messages sent by users should appear in the chat room in real time.

4. Message History: The chat application should store the history of messages for each chat room, which should be visible to users when they join the room.

5. Private Messaging: Users should be able to send private messages to other users.
